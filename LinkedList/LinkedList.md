# LinkedList
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers(entity that point to the next element)

# Arrays vs Linked List 
|   S.No.   |   ARRAY   |   LINKED LIST |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
|1.|An array is a grouping of data elements of equivalent data type.|	A linked list is a group of entities called a node. The node includes two segments: data and address.|
|2.|	It stores the data elements in a contiguous memory zone.|	It stores elements randomly, or we can say anywhere in the memory zone.|
|3.	|In the case of an array, memory size is fixed, and it is not possible to change it during the run time.	|In the linked list, the placement of elements is allocated during the run time.|
|4.	|The elements are not dependent on each other.|	The data elements are dependent on each other.|
|5.	|The memory is assigned at compile time.|	The memory is assigned at run time.|
|6.|	It is easier and faster to access the element in an array.|	In a linked list, the process of accessing elements takes more time.|
|7.	|In the case of an array, memory utilization is ineffective.	|In the case of the linked list, memory utilization is effective.|
|8.|When it comes to executing any operation like insertion, deletion, array takes more time.	|When it comes to executing any operation like insertion, deletion, the linked list takes less time|

# Some Standard Linked List Operations 
* Traverse – Iterate through the nodes in the linked list starting from the head node.
* Append – Attach a new node (to the end) of a list
* Prepend – Attach a new node (to the beginning) of the list
* Insert – attach a new node to a specific position on the list
* Delete – Remove/Delink a node from the list
* Count – Returns the no of nodes in linked list\

# Types of Linked List –
