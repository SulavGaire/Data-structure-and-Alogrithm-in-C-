# What is a Data Structure ?

- In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
- Data Structure is a way in which data is stored on a computer.

# What is an Algorithm ?

- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
- An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that are carried in a specific order to perform specific task.

**Algorithms typically have the following characteristics** 

1. Inputs : 0 or more input values.
2. Outputs : 1 or more than 1 output.
3. Unambiguity : clear and simple instructions.
4. Finiteness : Limited number of instructions.
5. Effectiveness : Each instruction has an impact on the overall process.

**Example**
Write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by user. 

- *Step* 1: Start
- *Step* 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum.
- *Step* 3: Read values num1 and num2.
- *Step* 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.(sum←num1+num2 )
- *Step* 5: Display sum
- *Step* 6: Stop

# Abstract Data Types
Abstract data type are *like user defined data type* on which we can perform functions without knowing what is there inside the datatype and how the operations are performed on them.

**2 Ways of looking at Data Structures –**

- Mathematical/Logical/Abstract Models/Views
- Implementation
